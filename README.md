# Student Database Management System - Readme

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of a Student Database Management System as part of the course IFT 530: Advanced Database Management Systems. The system aims to automate the manual record management processes in educational institutions, providing a platform for students, faculty, and administrators to access and manage crucial data efficiently. The project covers various aspects of database management, including the design of ORM diagrams, relational schemas, table creation, additional constraints, NoSQL implementation using Couchbase, and the execution of complex queries.

## Tools and Technologies Involved

- **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):** SQL Server is used to design the relational schema, create tables, and enforce constraints.
  
- **ORM Diagrams:** Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) diagrams are employed to visualize the relationships between entities in the system.

- **NoSQL Database:** Couchbase Enterprise 7+ Edition is utilized for NoSQL implementation, where JSON documents are created to represent entities such as students, staff, schools, and reports.

- **SQL:** Structured Query Language is extensively used to define and manipulate the data in the relational database.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Database Design:** The project involves the creation of ORM diagrams, relational schemas, and tables, helping participants understand the principles of designing a robust database structure.

2. **SQL Mastery:** Participants gain hands-on experience in writing SQL queries, stored procedures, triggers, and functions, enhancing their proficiency in managing and retrieving data.

3. **NoSQL Implementation:** Working with Couchbase introduces participants to NoSQL databases, enabling them to handle diverse data structures and execute queries using SQL++.

4. **Data Retrieval and Analysis:** Complex queries are formulated to retrieve specific information, demonstrating the ability to extract meaningful insights from the database.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive learning experience in advanced database management, encompassing both relational and NoSQL databases. Participants gain practical skills in designing, implementing, and querying databases, preparing them for real-world applications in data management and analysis.
